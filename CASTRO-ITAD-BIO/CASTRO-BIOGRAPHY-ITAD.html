        <p><strong>August 6th, 2004</strong>, marked my birth in this world.<sup>1</sup> Born in <strong>Manila</strong>, specifically in <strong>Tondo</strong>.<sup>2</sup> My family of four consisting of me, my brother, and our loving parents, shared a small but lively home.<sup>3</sup> My dreams of being a <em>policeman</em> or <em>firefighter</em> swirled in my head but it was just for fun.<sup>4</sup> It is because I was hoping for a successful future.<sup>5</sup> Then, at the age of four, a rough incident with my bike led to a fractured left elbow and a four-month recovery period.<sup>6</sup> My experience back then was pretty hard.<sup>7</sup> Movement was limited because I did not want to experience this kind of event.<sup>8</sup> After that, I became a very cautious person.<sup>9</sup> My grandfather's affectionate nickname, "<cite>Owang</cite>", was given to me throughout childhood.<sup>10</sup> sounds funny but it was a constant reminder of his fondness.<sup>11</sup> Joining the world of education, I finished my kindergarten in our barangay’s daycare.<sup>12</sup> Moving to the elementary phase, the busy halls of <b>San Rafael Parochial School</b> (<u><i><b>SRPS</b></i></u>) became my second home.<sup>13</sup> It was filled with the happy experiences of my classmates and the thrill of learning.<sup>14</sup> But when the school bell finally rang, my true joy lay in the simple pleasures of outdoor games with my neighbors.<sup>15</sup> The quiet satisfaction of building elaborate <i>Lego</i> creations as well as the hobby of collecting its limited editions were also my favorite activities.<sup>16</sup> Before, I did not take my studies seriously because I was not still aware of their importance.<sup>17</sup> My parents' constant refrain, "<cite>Take your studies sincerely for a better future</cite>" resonated deeply.<sup>18</sup> It shaped me into a responsible student.<sup>19</sup> It was not just about grades, but about understanding the value of dedication and hard work – lessons that continue to guide me today.<sup>20</sup>

        <p>Growing taller and feeling awkward – that is how my teenage years began.<sup>1</sup> School crushes made me blush, and being shy made things even tougher.<sup>2</sup> Online games became my go-to for fun and enjoyment during my free time.<sup>3</sup> To be specific, I enjoyed playing block games because it powers my imagination.<sup>4</sup> On the other hand, there are bad choices: hanging out with friends who smoked and drank.<sup>5</sup> Sneaking out for late-night hangouts made me feel excited.<sup>6</sup> By the time I got caught by my parents, it was a wake-up call.<sup>7</sup> Dad always said, "Focus on studies", and his words hit me hard.<sup>8</sup> I knew I could do better.<sup>9</sup> Winning "<b>Best in ICT</b>" in grade 10 boosted my confidence.<sup>10</sup> The teenage years were a mix of fun and trouble, like a wild ride.<sup>11</sup> But school was important, and that is what I focused on <sup>12</sup> After finishing junior high school, I moved to my senior years.<sup>13</sup> Sadly, the pandemic happened and I will finish my senior year online.<sup>14</sup> Choosing the <b>STEM</b> strand felt right, thanks to my love for technology.<sup>15</sup> This was the moment when I found the <b>University of the East</b> (<var><b><u>UE</u></b></var>).<sup>16</sup> I spent my two years remaining years of high school in UE while only at online set-up.<sup>17</sup> Thankfully I graduated senior high <dfn>with honors</dfn>.<sup>18</sup> This phase taught me important lessons: be responsible, value education, and choose good friends who support you.<sup>19</sup> Maybe I picked some wrong friends, but I learned from it.<sup>20</sup> My teenage years were not perfect, but they made me who I am.<sup>21</sup> Growing up is tough, but I will always be ready for what is next!<sup>22</sup>

        <p>My first college steps were hesitant.<sup>1</sup> A mix of nerves and excitement under the new chapter.<sup>2</sup> Daily commutes tested my patience.<sup>3</sup> But yet the journey brought a certain satisfaction to my life.<sup>4</sup> Joining <b>COMSSO</b>, one of my college’s organizations, injected social warmth into the mix.<sup>5</sup> Attending the webinars was full of fun and recreation.<sup>6</sup> Drawn to technology, I chose <strong>Information Technology</strong>.<sup>7</sup> Aiming to carve my future in the tech world.<sup>8</sup> The subject of <i>History</i> felt like a constant uphill battle in my curriculum.<sup>9</sup> In simple words, it was hard.<sup>10</sup> But subjects like <i>Programming</i> sparked a joy of creation and connection.<sup>11</sup> My circle of friends blossomed unexpectedly during a group activity.<sup>12</sup> Leading to shared laughter and explorations beyond campus walls.<sup>13</sup> Adjusting from online classes to face-to-face was a struggle, but I learned to adapt and find new routines.<sup>14</sup> After finishing my first year, a <strong><em><u>1.50 GWA</u></em></strong> stood as a testament to my quiet perseverance.<sup>15</sup> I was so proud of myself because I survived it.<sup>16</sup> I hope this will be a consistent process in my career.<sup>17</sup> College life, so far, is a quiet melody, one I prefer in the peace of solitude.<sup>18</sup> Yet, I actively hone my <em>communication skills</em>, preparing for future interactions.<sup>19</sup> The overall journey feels smooth and manageable.<sup>20</sup> I am clinging to the hope of reaching graduation with unwavering dedication.<sup>21</sup> This experience has instilled a powerful lesson – you will never learn in deceit.<sup>22</sup>
