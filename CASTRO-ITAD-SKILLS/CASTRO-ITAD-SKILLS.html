        <p>When I was in high school, I found out that I was fascinated in terms of electricity.<sup>1</sup> That is why I am good at fixing electrical stuff at home.<sup>2</sup> In addition to that, I can also do <u>maintenance</u> and <u>installation</u> whenever there is a new appliance that needs to be installed in our home.<sup>3</sup> I love researching online to find solutions to tough problems.<sup>4</sup> I am working on explaining complicated things better but still, I find it very challenging.<sup>5</sup> I am pretty creative with <strong>video editing</strong> because I find it my best talent, especially if a group activity needs a video output.<sup>6</sup> I work well in teams and can adapt to new situations, like when I switched from online school to college.<sup>7</sup> Now, I am excited to learn programming to build <em>computer systems</em> and get better at networking.<sup>8</sup> Even though I am still learning to pay attention to the smallest details, I am good at figuring things out from data.<sup>9</sup> I know I can improve by taking on new challenges and learning new things because I am a very curious person who loves to explore new kinds of stuff.<sup>10</sup></p>

        <p>When I am not chilling with friends online through games, I grab my guitar and let the music flow.<sup>1</sup> Whether it is chasing away boredom or learning a fresh tune, music always helps me express myself.<sup>2</sup> Feeling playful? I love challenging my cousins to card games, testing my wits to win.<sup>3</sup> For some active fun, I head to our garage for a <em>badminton</em> match with my mom.<sup>4</sup> It is a great way to bond and get some exercise!<sup>5</sup> As a music lover, tunes are like air to me.<sup>6</sup> I listen to pop/rock music and sometimes even play along.<sup>7</sup> But when I need to expand my mind, I dive into learning new languages like <i><b>Spanish</b></i> and <i><b>French</b></i>.<sup>8</sup> It is challenging but rewarding!<sup>9</sup> Sometimes, I just want to escape into another world.<sup>10</sup> That is when I curl up with a good movie or get lost in my favorite manga collection.<sup>11</sup> Each has its special place in my heart.<sup>12</sup> But I do not think it is all fun and games!<sup>13</sup> In the kitchen, I transform into a master chef, whipping up delicious dishes and trying out new recipes.<sup>14</sup> It is fun to experiment and see what tasty creations I can come up with.<sup>15</sup> Speaking of unique hobbies, I have a soft spot for birds.<sup>16</sup> I collect lovebirds and adore taking care of them.<sup>17</sup> They are like little feathered friends!<sup>18</sup> Finally, my most daring hobby is something called <b>pyrography</b>.<sup>19</sup> It is basically creating art with fire and music!<sup>20</sup> I upload videos of my creations on <cite><b>YouTube</b></cite>, and it is a lot of fun to combine these two seemingly different things.<sup>21</sup> But my hobbies do not stop there!<sup>22</sup> I am always open to trying new activities and exploring my interests.<sup>23</sup></p>

        <p>Watching <u>circuits work</u> with my own wiring, <u>running programs</u> that I coded, and <u>websites blossom</u> under my <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> - that is my thrill!<sup>1</sup> Good news sparks a smile, and arcade games, whether solo or with friends, fuel the fun.<sup>2</sup> "<i>Attack on Titan</i>" is not just an anime; it is a childhood companion that instilled valuable lessons in me.<sup>3</sup> Programming my systems someday? That is the ultimate coding dream!<sup>4</sup> Fire is more than just mesmerizing flames; it is a scientific marvel waiting to be explored (with safety always in mind, of course!).<sup>5</sup> Now, you are wondering why I included fire.<sup>6</sup> It is because I am a pyro lover.<sup>7</sup> I always make art with fire by making a pyro-musical show through a simulator application.<sup>8</sup> Snowy <b>Canada</b> and the wonders of <b>Japan</b> beckon me to travel.<sup>9</sup> Whether as a programmer or engineer, the digital future awaits, and I am ready to dive in!<sup>10</sup> Every tree planted from seed adds a touch of green, and I am proud to be a part of it.<sup>11</sup> My interests may be unique, but they fuel my passion to learn, create, and connect with others.<sup>12</sup></p>
