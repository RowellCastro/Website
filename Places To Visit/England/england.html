                Liverpool is a city and metropolitan borough in Merseyside, North West England. It had a population of 486,100 at the 2021 census. The city is located on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, adjacent to the Irish Sea, and is approximately 178 miles (286 km) from London. The wider Liverpool built-up area is the third largest in England and Wales outside London. Liverpool itself is the largest settlement in the Liverpool City Region, which is the fourth largest combined authority in the UK with a population of 1,551,722 in 2021. The city also forms part of a larger urban region of over 2 million people which extends in to the neighbouring counties of northeast Wales, Cheshire and Lancashire. The region shares political boundaries and significant economic connections. <br><br>
                As a music enthusiast and a fan of The Beatles, visiting Liverpool, England, is a dream come true for me. The city holds a special place in music history as the birthplace of the iconic band, and exploring its Beatles-related attractions is a major draw. First and foremost, I'm eager to visit The Beatles Story, an immersive museum that chronicles the rise of the Fab Four from their humble beginnings to global superstardom. From memorabilia and interactive exhibits to recreations of significant moments in their career, this museum promises an unforgettable journey through Beatles history. Moreover, no visit to Liverpool would be complete without a pilgrimage to iconic Beatles landmarks such as The Cavern Club. Stepping into this legendary venue, where The Beatles performed nearly 300 times, feels like stepping back in time to witness the energy and excitement of their early gigs. <br><br>
                Beyond The Beatles, Liverpool offers a vibrant cultural scene with world-class museums, galleries, and theaters. I'm excited to stroll along the picturesque Albert Dock, explore the fascinating exhibits at the Tate Liverpool, and soak in the city's rich maritime heritage at the Merseyside Maritime Museum. Additionally, Liverpool's lively nightlife and bustling food scene are sure to delight. Whether it's enjoying live music in a cozy pub or sampling delicious cuisine in one of the city's many restaurants, there's something for every taste and mood.
